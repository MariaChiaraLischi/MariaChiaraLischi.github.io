# Building with Next.js

Next.js has become my go-to framework for building modern web applications. Here's why I love it:

## Why Next.js?

- **Server-Side Rendering** out of the box
- **File-based routing** makes navigation intuitive
- **API routes** for backend functionality
- **Excellent developer experience**

## Key Features

1. **Static Site Generation (SSG)**
2. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
3. **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**
4. **Built-in CSS support**

## Getting Started

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

The framework continues to evolve, and I'm excited to see what's next!
